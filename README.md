**Introducing LocationLists: A SwiftUI App frontend for Creating Location-Based Lists (Open Source!)**

Hey everyone! 
I'm excited to share a project that I had helped a friend with for design and frontend development. This is a SwiftUI frontend development for the app that allows you to create location-based lists for anything you can imagine!

The project includes various screens and bottomsheet customizations, allowing you to tailor the app's look and feel to your liking.
Reusable styles for typefaces, buttons, input boxes, and more make the app clean and efficient.
Open Source and Ready to Contribute!
